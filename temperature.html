                <p>The Max Temperature vs. City Latitude chart shows a strong relationship between a cities latitude, distance North ( + ) or South ( - ) from the equator (0) and temperature.
                    As a cities latitude approches the equator, the maximum temperature increases. The data set appears to be made up of more cities that lie within the Norther Hemisphere.
                    The highest temperature recorded is approximatly 110 degrees Ferenheit in a city located 20 degrees south of the equator. Near the equator, the highest temperature recorded was closer to 90 degrees Ferenheit.
